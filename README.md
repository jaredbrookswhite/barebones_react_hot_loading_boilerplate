### Help
A couple tutorials can help you get an idea of what's going on.
[https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto](React Basics)
[https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux](Redux)
[https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/real-world](Redux App Pattern)

We don't necessarily need to use Redux, but the ideas behind it are very good for understanding application state in React.
