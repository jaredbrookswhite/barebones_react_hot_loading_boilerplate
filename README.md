### Help
A couple tutorials can help you get an idea of what's going on.

  * [https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto](React Basics) - Quick rundown of the framework.

  * [https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux](Redux) - Redux, a great way to manage application state.

  * [https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/real-world](Redux App Pattern) - The redux application pattern, a great way to set up app structure.

We don't necessarily need to use Redux, but the ideas behind it are very good for understanding application state in React.
